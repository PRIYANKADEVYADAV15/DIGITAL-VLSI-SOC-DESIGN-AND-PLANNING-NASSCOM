# Sky130 Day1-Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK
## How to talk to computers
### 1.Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs
#### We all might have come across a simple Arduino Board in our lives(as shown below). An Arduino board is a microcontroller-based-development platform used to build electronic projects easily. It combines a programmable chip (as shown in the encircled region) with a PCB, input/output pins, USB interface, power regulators, and other helpful components. In this project we will learn how to design this microprocessor chip.Following the steps starting from Modelling the specifications using C language, RTL(verilog/VHDL) to getting the final layout in the form of GDSII file format which is sent to the foundary.

#### The above ARDUINO BOARD can also be described in the form of a block diagram. Showing the main processor(chip) along with various interfaces.

#### COMPONENTS OF CHIP:
#### The chip is a QFD-48 package, QFD means 'Quad-Flat No-lead', which has terminals on four side with no pins. It includes 48 contacts which are metal pads. 
#### 1. Pads-Through whcih we can send signals inside and outside the chip.
#### 2. Core- Place where digital logic gates are fixed (eg.- MUX, AND gate, Or gate, etc.)
#### 3. Die- It is the size of the entire chip, gets manufactured on silicon wafer.

#### A typical chip consists of RISC-V SOC, SRAM, ADCs, DACs, PLL, and SPI.

### 2.Introduction to RISC-V
#### RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the RISC design principles.It was developed at the University of California, Berkeley to be simple, modular, and royalty-free— making it ideal for research, industry, and education. An ISA(Instruction Set Architecture) defines how software communicates hardware or simply, how to talk to computers. There are different basic instructions to define integer operations.
#### Given below is the layout starting from writing the C program which is then converted into Assembly Language--> It is converted into Machine Language--> Then into Binary format--> The bits are then executed in the layout.
